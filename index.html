        <h4>Marriage is a Private Affair Summary Questions and Answers</h4>

        <h2 id="page1">Write down a summary of Marriage Is A Private Affair. </h2>

        <p><b>Answer:</b> Chinua Achebe is the most influential African writer who has presented in his novels
            and short stories an authentic account of the African society, especially the conflict between tradition and
            modernity.
            In this short story also we have this very theme presented in a poignant manner.</p>

        <p>Nnaemeka and Nene, belonging to two different tribes, meet in Lagos and decide to marry.
            But as Nnaemeka knows that his father, Okeke, would not agree to this he postpones communication of
            this fact to him by post or direct means. When he arrives at home for a short vacation Okeke tells him that
            they have selected Ugoye,
            the eldest daughter of their neighbor, as his wife.</p>
        <p>But very firmly Nnaemeka refuses to marry the girl chosen by his parents.
            This shocks Okeke; and in a fit of anger, he stops speaking to him. When Nnaemeka’s intention of marrying a
            girl from another
            tribe is
            known to other villagers they are mortified and express great sympathy for Okeke.</p>
        <p>They even suggest that the local medicine man should be consulted and Nnaemeka be given some
            herbal drugs to cure him of this mental derangement.
            But Okeke, in spite of being rigid about parental authority, is free from these superstitions.</p>
        <p>Back in Lagos Nnaemeka marries Nene and the estrangement between the
            father and the son is complete. To Nnaemeka’s request for spending some part of his vacation, Okeke gives a
            very harsh reply. It would be unfair to say that Okeke endured this separation from his son without a mental
            conflict. He suffered inwardly,
            but he could not bring himself to accept the unconventional marriage.</p>
        <p>After a few years Okeke receives a letter from Nene. She had written that their
            two grandsons wanted to be with him and she had found it impossible to let them know of the old man’s
            opposition. Okeke reads the letter and an unusual results which was further supported by the sudden rains.
            His mind started imagining them standing infront of him and he spends the night,
            full of remorse and regret over his undue harshness.</p>
        <p>The story is a very honest study of the hold of social authority and its image in African society.
            In spite of being true Christians and adapting themselves to modern ways of living and education,
            there are still old people like Okeke who prefer to be cheated by old norms. That the problem has a
            human angle is nicely revealed in Nene's letter and Okeke's subsequent sentimental reaction.</p>

        <h2>Find instances of conflict between tradition and modernism in the story.</h2>
        <p>The dialogue between Okeke and Nnaemeka is full of the conflict between tradition and modernism. Nnaemeka
            tells his father that he cannot marry Ugoye as he does not love her; his father says that it was not
            expected at all of him. Then Nnaemeka has to admit that he is already, engaged to Nene, a girl who teaches
            in a Christian girl’s school. Okeke is not persuaded nor does he believe that a Christian woman should
            teach. Best gifts for your loved ones.</p>
        <p>He quotes St. Paul’s letter to the Corinthians in which he said that women should keep silent. It is clear
            that Okeke continues to believe in values and practices that were observed by his society. He thinks that
            they are so sacrosanct that they cannot be changed. It is a pity that he quotes the Bible to support his ‘
            arguments.</p>
        <p>The second instance can be seen in Okeke’s rigid stance after Nnaemeka’s marriage. That he does not allow his
            son and daughter-in-law to call on him is an indication of the hold of tradition on him.</p>
